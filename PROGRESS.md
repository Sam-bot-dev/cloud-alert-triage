## Change Log

### 2026-04-08 — Agent (Phase 13 — HF Deployment + Intelligence Boost)
- **Phase**: 13 — HF Deployment + Intelligence Boost
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **What was done**:
  - Deployed to HuggingFace Space: `notUbaid-cloudalert-triage-ai.hf.space`
  - Docker deployment verified successful
  - API endpoints working: `/`, `/health`, `/reset`, `/step`, `/state`
  - Added intelligent enhancements to inference.py:
    - Repeated alert detection (groups same service+metric)
    - Dynamic alert prioritization (severity + upstream services)
    - Smart fallback (safer than skip for critical/high)
    - Improved system prompt with better strategy
  - Inference agent tested with Groq LLM:
    - Easy: score=0.772 (6 steps)
    - Medium: score=0.5915 (25 steps)
    - Hard: score=0.3154 (45 steps)
  - Score improvement: Hard improved from 0.10 → 0.32 (+220%)
  - Fixed API key priority (GROQ_API_KEY for Groq, OPENAI_API_KEY for OpenAI)
  - Added home endpoint `/` for Space preview

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase F — Final Integration Review)
- **Phase**: Phase F — Final consistency audit
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**: `server/rewards.py`, `README.md`
- **Issues found and fixed**:
  1. `rewards.py` `_reward_triage` docstring said `+0.10` for severity within-1-level but code awards `+0.30`. Fixed docstring to match code.
  2. `README.md` env var table had auth priority backwards (said OPENAI_API_KEY primary, HF_TOKEN fallback). Fixed to match code: HF_TOKEN primary, OPENAI_API_KEY fallback.
  3. `README.md` setup example showed `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`. Fixed to `export HF_TOKEN=hf_...`.
- **Verified clean**:
  - Stealth key: `"stealth": True` in scenario_generator.py L582, `inc.get("stealth")` in grading.py L205. ✅ Consistent.
  - Severity partial-credit: 0.30 in rewards.py code+header+docstring, 0.3 in grading.py. ✅ Consistent.
  - Link-usage multiplier: absent from grading.py. ✅ Correctly removed.
  - Dynamic cascade: grading.py L54-58 filters dynamic_alert_ids. ✅ Policy documented in README.
  - Inference fallback: `minimal_fallback_action` returns skip only. ✅ No answer-key logic.
  - HF_TOKEN priority: inference.py L55 prefers HF_TOKEN. ✅ README now matches.
- **Tests**: All 236 pass.
- **Remaining blockers** (human action):
  1. Run `python inference.py` with live LLM key to fill baseline scores in README.
  2. Docker build/run validation.
  3. HF Space deployment.

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase E — Docs & Decision Log)
- **Phase**: Phase E — Docs polishing and finalizing decisions
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**: `docs/decision_log.md`
- **What was done**:
  - Inserted concise layout descriptions of our primary environment design mechanics.
  - Specified why the **stealth mechanic** exists (triggering multi-hop analysis over simple keyword baiting).
  - Explicitly defined why **dynamic cascades scope out of the grader**, ensuring grading stability without discarding temporal pressure.
  - Justified the **inference prompt/minimal fallback design choices** (preventing built-in answer key mapping for better test credibility). 
- **What's next**: Proceed to execute final validation passes.

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase D — README Polish)
- **Phase**: Phase D — Strengthen docs and submission framing
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**: `README.md`
- **What was done**:
  - Added a compelling "Why This Matters" section addressing alert fatigue and benchmark relevance.
  - Expanded the explanation of the "stealth" incident mechanic for the hard task.
  - Aligned reward and grading descriptions exactly with the code (included coverage penalty `coverage^1.5`).
  - Clarified dynamic cascade mechanic and its exclusion from final grading.
- **Pending Human Action**: Run baseline agent with live LLM to populate baseline scores, set up HF Deployment space, and run Docker checks.
- **What's next**: Human review and deployment (Phase 13).

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase C — Inference Cleanup)
- **Phase**: Phase C — Reduce inference agent skepticism
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**: `inference.py`
- **What was done**:
  - Removed explicit lookup-table logic (`heuristic_action`, `heuristic_incident_links`, `_triage`, explicit metric/value answer keys).
  - Adopted `minimal_fallback_action` that simply emits a conservative `skip` rather than embedding solution intelligence.
  - Rewrote `SYSTEM_PROMPT` to remove exact value/threshold mappings and fake answers keys, focusing instead on general incident correlation/cascading logic strategies.
  - Changed authentication logic to prefer `HF_TOKEN` over `OPENAI_API_KEY` when both exist.
  - Kept API footprint minimal to maintain low token usage.
- **Inference Risks**: Without a reliable LLM call, the minimal fallback behavior will conservatively skip and score very poorly (approx. 0 or near 0). A failing LLM or rate limit will immediately result in an abysmal score, correctly acting as an honest benchmark without built-in safety nets mimicking intelligence.
- **What's next**: Phase D — strengthen docs and submission framing
- **Blockers**: None

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase B — Dynamic Cascade)
- **Phase**: Phase B — Make the environment more genuinely sequential
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**: `server/config.py`, `server/environment.py`, `server/grading.py`, `README.md`, `MAP.md`
- **What was done**:
  - Added `CASCADE_TRIGGER_STEP = 5` and `CASCADE_ELIGIBLE_SEVERITIES` to `server/config.py`.
  - Implemented `_maybe_spawn_cascade_alerts()` in `server/environment.py`:
    - After step 5, iterates original untriaged critical/high alerts (sorted by alert_id).
    - For each eligible alert, spawns one `dyn-{alert_id}` alert on the first alphabetical downstream dependent service.
    - Adds ground truth (`dependency_outage`, `high`, `acknowledge_and_monitor`) with `dynamic_generated: True` and `spawned_from_alert_id` metadata.
    - Tracks `_dynamic_alert_ids`, `_spawned_from`, `_original_alert_ids` sets.
    - Appends cascade feedback to the step's feedback string.
  - Updated `_make_state_snapshot()` to include `dynamic_alert_ids` for downstream use.
  - Updated `server/grading.py` `grade_episode()` to filter out dynamic alerts from ground_truth before scoring.
  - Documented the mechanic in `README.md` and `MAP.md`.
- **Determinism**: Fully deterministic — sorted alert_id iteration, sorted dependents from service_graph, fixed metric/threshold template.
- **Grading policy**: Dynamic alerts are excluded from the final grader score (safe-for-deadline policy). They participate in per-step rewards only.
- **Tests**: All 236 existing tests pass, including new dynamic cascade unit tests in `TestDynamicCascade` (verifying step 5 trigger, determinism, at-most-one spawn, and grader exclusion).
- **What's next**: Phase C (inference cleanup module)
- **Blockers for tests**: None.

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase A Fixes)
- **Phase**: Phase A Bug Fixes
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**: `server/scenario_generator.py`, `server/grading.py`, `server/rewards.py`, `README.md`
- **What was done**: 
  - Fixed stealth key mismatch: replaced `is_stealth` with `stealth` in `scenario_generator.py` to match `grading.py`.
  - Fixed severity partial-credit mismatch: updated `server/rewards.py` (0.10 -> 0.30) and `README.md` to reflect consistent 0.3 partial credit for severity within 1 level, matching the grader behavior.
  - Removed fragile `_link_usage_bonus` logic entirely from `server/grading.py` and used incident-link F1 directly.
- **What's next**: Phase B — make the environment more genuinely sequential (dynamic cascade mechanic)
- **Blockers**: None

## Change Log

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Final Integration Validation)
- **Phase**: Final submission validation
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - `scripts/smoke_test.py` — replaced `→` and `✅`/`❌` emoji with ASCII equivalents (Windows cp1252 console fix)
- **All checks performed and results**:
  - `python -m openenv.cli validate` → `[OK] cloud-alert-triage: Ready for multi-mode deployment` ✓
  - `GET /health` → 200 ✓
  - `POST /reset` easy/medium/hard → 200 ✓
  - `POST /step` (triage) → 200, reward numeric, done/grader_score correct ✓
  - `GET /state` → 200 ✓
  - `scripts/smoke_test.py` → 27/27 PASS, exit 0 ✓
  - `pytest tests/ -q` → 232/232 ✓
  - Docker: Docker Desktop not running — cannot verify locally
- **Blockers remaining** (human action required):
  1. **Docker build/run**: Start Docker Desktop, run `docker build -t cloud-alert-triage . && docker run --rm -p 7860:7860 cloud-alert-triage`, confirm `curl http://localhost:7860/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`
  2. **Baseline scores**: Run `python inference.py` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` set and server running; fill in README.md table (easy/medium/hard grader scores)
  3. **HF Deployment**: Create Docker-type HF Space, push repo, confirm live URL `/health` returns 200

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase 12 — Local Validation)
- **Phase**: 12 — Local Validation
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - `scripts/validate.sh` — `uvicorn` → `python -m uvicorn` (Windows PATH fix)
- **Checks performed**:
  - `pytest tests/ -q` → 232/232 ✓
  - GET /health → 200 ✓
  - POST /reset easy/medium/hard → 200 ✓
  - POST /step valid triage → 200 ✓
  - POST /step malformed action → 422 ✓
  - GET /state → 200 ✓
  - POST /reset invalid task_id → 422 ✓
  - Docker: Docker Desktop daemon not running on this machine — skipped
  - openenv validate: `openenv-core` installed but no CLI entry point found — skipped (VERIFY MANUALLY)
- **Blockers remaining** (human action required):
  1. **Baseline scores**: run `python inference.py` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` set; fill in README table
  2. **Docker build**: start Docker Desktop, run `docker build -t cloud-alert-triage .` then `docker run -p 7860:7860 cloud-alert-triage`; confirm `/health` returns 200
  3. **openenv validate**: run `openenv validate` in the project root; fix `openenv.yaml` if any fields are rejected
  4. **HF Deployment**: create HF Space (Docker type), push repo, confirm live URL returns 200

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase 14 — README / Final Polish)
- **Phase**: 14 — Final Polish
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - `README.md` — fully written (replaced placeholder stub)
- **What was done**:
  Wrote complete judge-facing README per master plan Section 5 spec.
  Sections: overview, why it matters, architecture diagram, observation space (with Alert field table), action space (all 3 types with examples + enum tables), task descriptions (easy/medium/hard), per-step reward table, grader component weights table, accuracy definitions, full API reference, setup (local + Docker), environment variables table, baseline score table (placeholders), project structure, team, license.
  All details verified against implemented code — no invented features.
- **Placeholders remaining** (human input needed):
  - Baseline scores table: `easy`, `medium`, `hard` scores require a live run with a real LLM key
- **What's next**: Phase 13 — HF Deployment (human action required)
- **Blockers**: Baseline scores require `OPENAI_API_KEY` + live server run

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase 10 — Validation bug fix)
- **Phase**: 10 — Tests
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - `tests/test_environment.py` — fixed 2 tests (lines ~365, ~447)
- **Root cause**: `test_cumulative_reward_tracked_across_steps` and `test_state_cumulative_reward_with_penalty` were written when `rewards.py` was a stub returning `0.0`. Both assumed the first valid triage yields `0.0` reward, so double-triage at `-0.15` would produce a cumulative of `-0.15`. With the real rewards implementation, the first triage on `alert-001` (using `severity="high"` against an alert whose true severity differs by 1 level) yields `+0.10` partial credit, making the cumulative `-0.05` instead.
- **Fix**: Captured `cumulative_reward` after step 1 in both tests, then asserted step 2 reduces it by exactly `0.15` — correctly isolating the double-triage penalty without assuming a specific first-step reward.
- **Tests**: 232/232 passing (`pytest tests/ -q`)
- **What's next**: Phase 12 — Local Validation (`bash scripts/validate.sh`)
- **Blockers**: None

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase 11 — Docker)
- **Phase**: 11 — Docker
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - `.dockerignore` — created (new file; prevents cache/test/secret pollution in image)
  - `PROGRESS.md` — updated Phase 11 status
- **What was done**:
  Verified `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, and `scripts/validate.sh` against master plan
  Section 5 / Phase 11 requirements. All three were already correct and complete:
  - `Dockerfile`: `python:3.11-slim` base, `WORKDIR /app`, requirements-first layer,
    `COPY . .`, `EXPOSE 7860`, `CMD ["uvicorn", "server.app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "7860"]` ✓
  - `requirements.txt`: fastapi, uvicorn[standard], pydantic>=2, openai, httpx ✓
  - `scripts/validate.sh`: 7-check script (health, reset, step, openenv validate, docker build) ✓
  Only gap was missing `.dockerignore`. Without it `COPY . .` includes `__pycache__/`,
  `.pytest_cache/`, `.env`, `.git/`, `docs/` — bloating the image and risking accidental
  secret inclusion. Added `.dockerignore` covering all standard exclusions.
- **Local Docker checks intended**:
  ```
  docker build -t cloud-alert-triage .
  docker run --rm -p 7860:7860 cloud-alert-triage &
  curl -s http://localhost:7860/health           # → {"status":"ok"}
  curl -s -X POST http://localhost:7860/reset \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"task_id":"easy","seed":42}' | head -c 200
  # Or run the full validation script:
  bash scripts/validate.sh
  ```
- **What's next**: Phase 12 — Local Validation (`bash scripts/validate.sh`)
- **Blockers**: None — requires Docker to be installed locally
- **Assumptions**: No OS-level system packages needed (pure Python stack). `python:3.11-slim` is sufficient.

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase 9 — inference.py, restored)
- **Phase**: 9 — Inference Script
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - `inference.py` — fully rewritten to restore LLM-based spec (prior version was replaced with a rule-based heuristic that did not use OpenAI SDK)
  - `PROGRESS.md` — updated
- **What was done**:
  Restored `inference.py` to the master plan Section 12 / Phase 9 specification.
  The file found on disk had been replaced with a pure heuristic classifier that used no
  OpenAI SDK, read no API env vars, had a wrong log format (`[START]` missing `env`/`model`
  fields), computed `score` as average reward (not `grader_score`), and had no timeout handling.
  Rewrote from scratch to spec:
  - `from openai import OpenAI` ✓
  - Reads `ENV_URL`, `API_BASE_URL`, `MODEL_NAME`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` (fallback `HF_TOKEN`) ✓
  - Runs tasks easy → medium → hard with `seed=42` ✓
  - Exact log format: `[START] {"task":…,"env":"cloud-alert-triage","model":…}` ✓
  - `[STEP] {"step":…,"action":…,"reward":…,"done":…,"error":…}` ✓
  - `[END] {"success":…,"steps":…,"score":…,"rewards":[…]}` — `score` = `grader_score` from info ✓
  - `parse_action`: strips markdown fences, falls back to `skip` ✓
  - Compact prompts: untriaged alerts only, context truncated, service map on step 1 only ✓
  - Per-task deadline: 6 min; global deadline: 20 min; LLM call timeout: 30s ✓
  - `temperature=0`, `max_tokens=256`, last-6-turn history window ✓
  All 15 automated checks pass (syntax, env vars, log tags, timeouts, grader_score).
- **What's next**: Phase 10 — `pytest tests/ -v` full suite
- **Blockers**: Live testing requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `HF_TOKEN` + running server
- **Human inputs needed**:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` or `HF_TOKEN=hf_...`
  - Start server: `uvicorn server.app:app --port 7860`
  - Run: `python inference.py`

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase 6 — Graders)
- **Phase**: 6 — Graders
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - `server/grading.py` — fully implemented (replaced stub); subsequently modified to add coverage penalty, stricter severity partial credit (+0.3), link_usage_bonus, and skip_ratio penalty
  - `tests/test_graders.py` — autouse skip fixture removed; import uncommented; 16 tests completed and passing
- **What was done**:
  Implemented `grade_episode(task_id, final_state_dict) -> float` with all 5 accuracy
  components and stealth bonus per master plan Section 9. Applied per-task weights.
  All helper functions are pure, no side effects, deterministic.
  Scoring components: `_root_cause_accuracy`, `_severity_accuracy`, `_remediation_accuracy`,
  `_incident_link_f1` (pair-set F1 with vacuous 1.0 for no-incident scenarios),
  `_false_alarm_accuracy`, `_stealth_bonus` (hard only, reads `stealth: True` from incidents list).
  Coverage penalty (`coverage^1.5`) added to penalise agents that triage few alerts.
  Output clamped to [0.0, 1.0] and rounded to 6dp for determinism.
- **Tests**: 16/16 passing
  - TestEasyGrader: 6 tests (perfect, all-wrong, empty, partial, range, severity partial credit)
  - TestGraderDeterminism: 2 tests (same-input-same-output, different-decisions-different-scores)
  - TestMediumGrader: 4 tests (incident linking, no-links below 1.0, FA identification, range)
  - TestHardGrader: 4 tests (stealth bonus exact +0.05, no stealth = no bonus, link weight comparison, range)
- **What's next**: Phase 9 — inference.py
- **Blockers**: None
- **Assumptions**:
  - `incidents` list entries use `stealth: True` (bool) to mark the stealth incident in the hard scenario.
  - Agent link actions are also present in `agent_decisions` (environment records them in both `_agent_links` and `_agent_decisions`); grader reads from `agent_links` key in state snapshot.
  - `_make_state_snapshot()` does not include `agent_links` key explicitly — grader reads `agent_links` from `final_state_dict.get("agent_links", [])`.

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase 8 — openenv.yaml)
- **Phase**: 8 — OpenEnv Metadata
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - `openenv.yaml` — audited, confirmed correct, no structural changes required
- **What was done**:
  Audited the existing `openenv.yaml` (scaffolded during Phase 1) against master plan
  Section 11 and Phase 8 requirements. File is syntactically valid YAML (spaces only,
  no tabs, quoted version string) and structurally matches the master plan verbatim.
  No corrections were needed to content or formatting. Phase 8 is formally closed.
- **Validation command**: `make validate` → `openenv validate` (requires `openenv-core` installed globally; NOT in requirements.txt — it is a dev-only tool)
- **What's next**: Phase 9 — inference.py (verify env-var reading, run end-to-end)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Assumptions**: `openenv-core` is installed in the dev environment separately.

### ⚠️ MANUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED — openenv.yaml

The following fields cannot be verified without running `openenv validate` against the
installed version of `openenv-core`. Mark each as verified once confirmed:

| Field / Section | Risk | Action |
|----------------|------|--------|
| `endpoints.state: /state` | `/state` is not a standard OpenEnv endpoint. Unknown if openenv-core allows extra keys or throws on unknown ones. | Run `openenv validate`; if it errors on `state`, remove that line from `endpoints`. |
| `tasks[].difficulty` | `difficulty` may not be in the openenv-core task schema. May be silently ignored or may cause a validation error. | Run `openenv validate`; remove if it errors. |
| `action_space` / `observation_space` | `type: object` + `description` is the plan's format. Actual openenv-core may expect a stricter JSON Schema or different field names. | Inspect `openenv-core` source or docs for the expected shape of these blocks. |
| `version`, `author`, `tags` | May be optional or unrecognized. Generally safe but unconfirmed. | Run `openenv validate`; these are low-risk even if ignored. |
| Required fields completeness | Plan says VERIFY MANUALLY — there may be required fields not covered (e.g., `reward_range`, `max_steps`, `grader`). | Run `openenv validate` immediately; read the error output. |

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase 7 — API Server)
- **Phase**: 7 — API Server
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - `server/app.py` — fully implemented (replaced stub)
  - `tests/test_api.py` — fully implemented (replaced stub, 47 tests)
- **What was done**:
  Implemented FastAPI app with all four endpoints.
  - `POST /reset`: accepts `ResetRequest`, calls `env.reset()`, wraps Observation in `{"observation": ...}`.
  - `POST /step`: accepts `Action` (Pydantic validates enums + required fields), calls `env.step()`, returns `StepResult.model_dump()`.
  - `GET /state`: guards `env._active`; returns `EnvironmentState.model_dump()`. Returns 400 if called before reset.
  - `GET /health`: returns `{"status": "ok"}`.
  - `CORSMiddleware(allow_origins=["*"])` added.
  - `@exception_handler(ValueError)` → 422 (bad task_id from env.reset).
  - `@exception_handler(RuntimeError)` → 400 (step before reset from env.step).
  Written full test suite (47 tests) covering all endpoints, error paths, episode lifecycle, state inspection, and determinism.
- **Endpoint tests added**:
  - TestHealth (3): 200, status=ok, no side effects
  - TestReset (19): all task sizes, observation fields, alert counts, determinism, invalid task_id 422, missing body defaults, clears prior episode
  - TestStep (15): triage/skip/link 200, response fields, pending_count decrement, triaged flag, invalid action 422, feedback present, step_number increments
  - TestStepBeforeReset (1): isolated fresh env → 400
  - TestFullEpisode (5): completes, grader_score in info, step-after-done, budget exhaustion, perfect-run reward sum
  - TestState (10): 200, ground_truth, task_id, seed, step_number, incidents, field validation, 400 before reset, done=False mid-episode, grader_score=None mid-episode
- **What's next**: Phase 8 — openenv.yaml
- **Blockers**: None
- **Assumptions**:
  - `/reset` wraps Observation in `{"observation": ...}` (matches master plan Section 10 response example).
  - `/step` returns `StepResult` flat (has `observation`, `reward`, `done`, `info` at top level).
  - `/state` returns `EnvironmentState` flat (no wrapper).
  - Invalid `task_id` is surfaced as `ValueError` from `env.reset()` and mapped to 422 by the custom exception handler.
  - `env._active` is the correct guard for "no episode" state; raises `RuntimeError` in `env.step()` which maps to 400.

### 2026-04-07 — Agent (Phase 5 — Rewards)
- **Phase**: 5 — Rewards
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - `server/rewards.py` — fully implemented (replaced stub)
  - `tests/test_rewards.py` — fully implemented (replaced stub, 42 tests)
  - `server/environment.py` — removed 3 duplicate `reward += self._budget_penalty()` calls (wiring fix to prevent double-counting now that compute_reward handles budget pressure internally)
- **What was done**:
  Implemented all reward logic from master plan Section 8 exactly.
  - `compute_reward`: dispatches to type-specific helpers + adds `_penalty_budget`.
  - `_reward_triage`: +0.30 root_cause, +0.30/+0.10 severity exact/within-1, +0.20 remediation, +0.10 incident-link bonus.
  - `_reward_link`: +0.15 per correct pair, -0.10 per wrong pair (uses `combinations`).
  - `_reward_skip`: +0.20 true false_alarm, -0.30 real alert.
  - `_penalty_budget`: -0.05 when step >= 80% of max_steps.
  Wiring fix: environment.py was applying `_budget_penalty()` on top of `compute_reward()` (which now includes it). Removed the 3 duplicate calls from `_apply_triage`, `_apply_link`, `_apply_skip`.
- **Reward examples validated** (all match master plan exactly):
  - Perfect triage, no pressure: 0.80
  - Perfect triage, step=9/10: 0.75
  - Severity off by 1: 0.60
  - Severity off by 3: 0.50
  - Skip false_alarm: +0.20
  - Skip real alert: -0.30
  - Correct link pair: +0.15
  - Wrong link pair: -0.10
  - Budget threshold at exactly 80%: -0.05
  - Incident-link bonus on perfect triage: 0.90
- **Tests**: 42 tests in test_rewards.py (TestRewardTriage×12, TestRewardLink×7, TestRewardSkip×5, TestPenaltyBudget×8, TestComputeReward×13, TestMasterPlanExamples×5)
- **What's next**: Phase 6 — Graders (`server/grading.py`)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Assumptions**:
  - `_make_state_snapshot()` passes `step_number` = steps taken *before* the current action. This is correct: budget pressure fires at `step_number >= 0.8 * max_steps`, which aligns with the env's step counter at the time of dispatch.
  - `_reward_link` reads incident membership from `env_state_dict["incidents"]` (list of incident dicts with `incident_id` and `alert_ids` keys), NOT from `ground_truth_list`. This matches the scenario_generator output format.
  - The incident-link bonus fires only if the agent previously grouped the alert with *at least one other true member* of the same incident. Grouping it with a non-member does not trigger the bonus.

### 2026-04-06 — Agent (Phase 4 — Environment Core)
- **Phase**: 4 — Environment Core
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - `server/environment.py` — fully implemented (replaced stub)
  - `tests/test_environment.py` — fully implemented (55 tests; replaced stub)
  - `server/rewards.py` — minimal stub added: `compute_reward()` returns 0.0
  - `server/grading.py` — minimal stub added: `grade_episode()` returns 0.0
- **What was done**:
  Implemented `AlertTriageEnv` with `reset()`, `step()`, and `state()`.
  - `reset(task_id, seed)`: validates task_id, calls `generate_scenario`, builds
    Alert objects, initialises all episode state, returns Observation.
  - `step(action)`: accepts Action model or plain dict (Pydantic coercion);
    dispatches to `_apply_triage`, `_apply_link`, `_apply_skip`; handles all
    edge cases directly in the env layer; delegates base reward to
    `compute_reward` stub; calls `grade_episode` stub on completion.
  - `state()`: returns full EnvironmentState including hidden ground truth.
  Edge cases handled in env layer (not in rewards stub):
    - step() before reset() → RuntimeError
    - invalid alert_id (triage/skip/link) → −0.10
    - already-triaged alert (triage/skip) → −0.15
    - invalid action format (Pydantic validation failure) → −0.10
    - step() after done → reward=0.0, done=True, no state mutation
    - budget exhaustion (step_count ≥ max_steps) → sets done, calls grader
    - budget pressure (≥80% used) → −0.05 additive penalty
  Minimal stubs added to rewards.py and grading.py to satisfy imports.
  Phase 5/6 can replace these stubs without touching environment.py.
- **Determinism**: environment state is fully deterministic given task_id+seed;
  no randomness introduced in environment.py itself.
- **Tests passing**: 55/55 (Python 3.12.3)
  - TestReset: 14 tests (all tasks, invalid id, seed determinism)
  - TestStepBeforeReset: 1 test
  - TestStepValidActions: 11 tests (triage, skip, link_alerts)
  - TestStepEdgeCases: 10 tests (double triage, invalid ids, budget exhaustion)
  - TestFullEpisode: 5 tests (completion, grader_score, cumulative reward)
  - TestState: 14 tests (all fields, mid/post episode)
- **What’s next**: Phase 5 — Rewards (`server/rewards.py`)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Assumptions**:
  - `link_alerts` does NOT mark alerts as triaged (grouping-only action);
    pending_count is only reduced by triage/skip.
  - Budget-pressure penalty (−0.05) is applied additively in the env layer
    on top of whatever `compute_reward` returns; not double-applied in rewards.
  - `grade_episode` stub returns 0.0; `grader_score` in info will be 0.0
    until Phase 6 is implemented. Tests are written to accept any float in
    [0.0, 1.0] so they will keep passing after Phase 6 replaces the stub.
  - `_make_state_snapshot()` passes `ground_truth` to the grader; Phase 6
    should read it from `final_state_dict["ground_truth"]`.

### 2026-04-06 — Agent (Phase 3 test verification)
- **Phase**: 3 — Scenario Gen
- **Status**: VERIFIED COMPLETE (external pytest run)
- **Files changed**: None (read-only verification pass)
- **What was done**: Copied server/scenario_generator.py, server/config.py, server/service_graph.py, tests/test_scenario_gen.py to a clean Python 3.12.3 environment and ran the full test suite. All 24 tests passed (pytest collected 24, not 25 — one of the previously listed tests was a duplicate count).
- **Determinism checks confirmed**:
  - `test_easy_same_seed_identical` PASSED — same seed, same alert IDs
  - `test_medium_same_seed_identical` PASSED
  - `test_hard_same_seed_identical` PASSED
  - `test_easy_different_seeds_differ` PASSED — seed 42 ≠ seed 99
  - `test_ground_truth_deterministic` PASSED
- **Alert count checks confirmed**: easy=5, medium=15, hard=30 all PASSED
- **Enum validity**: root_cause, severity, remediation all valid for all tasks PASSED
- **Incident grouping**: easy=0, medium=2, hard=4-5 PASSED
- **GT-alert ID cross-reference**: every ground_truth entry references a real alert ID PASSED
- **Tests passing**: 24/24
- **What's next**: Phase 4 — Environment Core (server/environment.py)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Assumptions**: Pytest collected 24 tests (not 25 as noted previously — the count in the prior log was off by one; all substantive tests are present and passing).

### 2026-04-06 — Agent (Phase 3 complete — scenario_generator.py)
- **Phase**: 3 — Scenario Gen
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Files changed**:
  - server/scenario_generator.py — fully implemented (replaced stub)
  - tasks/task_easy.json — verified correct, no changes needed
  - tasks/task_medium.json — verified correct, no changes needed
  - tasks/task_hard.json — verified correct, no changes needed
  - tests/test_scenario_gen.py — verified correct (skipif guard now lifted on import)
- **What was done**:
  Implemented deterministic scenario generation for all three tasks using
  `random.Random(seed)` exclusively.
  - Easy: 5 independent alerts covering all 5 non-false-alarm root causes,
    services picked via `rng.sample`, root-cause types shuffled via `rng.shuffle`.
  - Medium: 15 alerts — 2 incidents (4 alerts each cascading through the service
    dependency graph via BFS), 5 independent alerts, 2 false alarms.
    INC-001 rooted at redis-cache (resource_exhaustion),
    INC-002 rooted at object-storage (network_failure).
  - Hard: 30 alerts — 5 incidents (4+4+4+3+3), 6 independent, 6 false alarms
    (one misleadingly marked CRITICAL).  INC-005 is a stealth incident: the root
    service (redis-cache) shows only subtle degradation while dependents fail loudly.
    Alerts list shuffled by a deterministic rng permutation for temporal interleaving.
  All metric values, version numbers, timestamps and shuffle orders are drawn from
  the seeded rng instance.  Every sorted()/rng.sample() call uses pre-sorted lists
  so results are stable across Python versions.
- **Determinism checks performed**:
  - `_cascade_chain` uses `sorted(get_dependents())` at each BFS step — no dict ordering
  - `rng.sample(_ALL_SERVICES, k)` — population is `get_service_names()` (sorted)
  - `rng.shuffle(rc_types)` — shuffles a sorted list of fixed length
  - Alert IDs assigned via a sequential counter — no randomness in ID assignment
  - Hard scenario shuffle uses `rng.shuffle(list(range(30)))` — pure integer list
  - Timestamps use integer `rng.randint` offsets applied to a fixed `_BASE_DT`
- **Tests passing**: tests/test_scenario_gen.py — 25 tests written, import guard now
  passes (run `pytest tests/test_scenario_gen.py -v` from cloud-alert-triage/ root)
- **What's next**: Phase 4 — Environment Core (server/environment.py)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Assumptions**:
  - For easy's dependency_outage case: if rng assigns this rc to a leaf-node service
    (no deps), the builder silently falls back to config_error. The gt still has a
    valid ROOT_CAUSE_CATEGORIES value, so tests remain green.
  - Hard independent and noise alerts may reuse services already involved in incidents
    (realistic — a service can generate multiple alert types).
  - `incidents` list for easy is `[]` (empty) — the test checks `len([]) == 0` via
    `[i for i in [] if i]`.
